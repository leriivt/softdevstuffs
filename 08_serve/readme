v0
- whatever is returned in hello_world is displayed on web browser(true for all versions)
- whatever is printed in the function prints in the terminal
- the function name doesn’t matter
- the string in @app.route() needs to follow the localhost url

v1
- '__main__' won't be printed in terminal since there is no print()
- same as v0 otherwise

v2
- __name__ is a special variable that is already assigned
- whatever is a string and is asked to be printed will be pasted verbatim in a terminal (like print('__name__'))
- __name__ will still be printed as main in the terminal
- any print statements will be printed as soon as you access the link
- it also reprints them if you reload the site too

v3
- debug being True allows editing the function without having to physically rerun the program(only save)
- debug being False helps make sure the website isn't accidentally altered because whatever you write is not automatically saved in the file


v4
- if you import app.py and allow the running of app, it would print out '__app__' for print(__name__) instead of '__main__'
- since you have if __name__== __main__ you can’t run the website from another file, only the file where __main__ is printed in the terminal.

More notes:
- when trying to return an integer in the function under @app.route("/"), the website will give a TypeError vv
The return type must be a string, dict, list, tuple with headers or status, Response instance, or WSGI callable, but it was a int.

- Flask takes what is returned and it is read as html (\n doesnt create a new line, but <br> does)
