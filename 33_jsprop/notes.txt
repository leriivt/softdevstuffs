Event capturing moves from the top of the DOM tree downwards towards its target (the first event that has useCapture=true) and directs it to the listener 
By default event capturing is set to false.
"This is like event bubbling but the order is reversed: 
so instead of the event firing first on the innermost element targeted, 
and then on successively less nested elements,
 the event fires first on the least nested element, 
 and then on successively more nested elements, 
 until the target is reached."

**Do all events that have capture set to true go first before those that dont??


Event bubbling moves from the bottom of the DOM tree upwards towards its target and directs it to the listener.
" event bubbles up from the innermost element that was clicked. "

- event.stopPropagation() stops bubbling up to other elements
- it is possible to click only the table
