What is printed in the terminal when accessing root:
***DIAG: this Flask obj ***
<Flask 'app'>
***DIAG: request obj ***
<Request 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' [GET]>
***DIAG: request.args ***
ImmutableMultiDict([])
***DIAG: request.headers ***

What is printed in the terminal after entering a username (thluffy) and clicking submit query:
***DIAG: this Flask obj ***
<Flask 'app'>
***DIAG: request obj ***
<Request 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=thluffy&sub1=Submit+Query' [GET]>
***DIAG: request.args ***
ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'thluffy'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')])
***DIAG: request.headers ***

Difference seems to be that in the second case the ImmutableMultiDict is filled with 
('username', 'thluffy'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query') and
the new request obj is the new url :
the url changes from http://127.0.0.1:5000/ -> http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=thluffy&sub1=Submit
It seems that "thluffy" will be replaced by whatever username is entered.

----------------------------------------

When print(request.args['username']) is uncommented from disp_loginpage(), we get a BadRequestKeyError
when accessing http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([]))
but no error from http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([]))
or http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=thluffy&sub1=Submit+Query (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'thluffy'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')]))

When print(request.args['username']) is uncommented from authenticate(), we no error
when accessing http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([]))
or http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=thluffy&sub1=Submit+Query (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'thluffy'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')]))
but a BadRequestKeyError from http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([]))

It seems that request.args['username'] is the value associated with the key 'username' in ImmutableMultiDict so there is an error when 
the 'username' key cannot be found
AND
what follows the ? in the URL denotes the contents of ImmutableMultiDict in the form:
?key0=value0&key1=value1   ==>   ImmutableMultiDict([('key0', 'value0'), ('key1', 'value1')])

This is further confirmed with print(request.args['username']) is uncommented from disp_loginpage()
and http://127.0.0.1:5000/?username=thluffy is accessed (request.args results in ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'thluffy')]))
and there is no BadRequestKeyError

----------------------------------------

Tried uncommenting "methods=['GET', 'POST'])" for both functions but there didn't seem to be any change in what was printed in the terminal.
When is POST used?

----------------------------------------

Tried to get print(app) to change output of <Flask 'app'> by changing all instances of the variable name app to apple, but output remained
the same.
Can you get it to change? How?
Possible by changing the file name?

----------------------------------------

Tried editing the line 37 in login.html from <input type="text" name="username"> to <input type="text" nam="username">
Now when entering a username and clicking submit we are redirected to http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?sub1=Submit+Query 
instead of http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=thluffy&sub1=Submit+Query
*NOTE: had to crtl+c and re-run app.py in terminal and open a new http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for this to work, otherwise would get the original redirect

It seems that for the the "username" key to be added to ImmutableMultiDict if the syntax is name=
Looking at the html documentation https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form
name seems to be a special attribute that helps create a unique reference to the data collected from the user.

Changing <input type="text" name="username"> to <input type="text" name="usrname"> seems to change the reference and
entering a username and clicking submit redirects to http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?usrname=thluffy&sub1=Submit+Query
instead of http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=thluffy&sub1=Submit+Query
