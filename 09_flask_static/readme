Prediction for foo.html:
Going to http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html would
lead to a website displaying one line "Is this plaintext, though?"

Prediction was true

----------------------------------
Q: What happens when you access this file
     via
      http://localhost:5000/static/foo
     ?

Prediction for foo:
Either everything in foo is diplayed (on one line?) or
You get an error or
You get the same thing as http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html
-----------------------------------

Notes:
-What ends up happening is the web browser downloads foo
when http://localhost:5000/static/foo is accessed by user
and terminal prints
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Oct/2022 13:49:15] "GET /static/foo HTTP/1.1" 200 -

-When you access 127.0.0.1/static/foo.html the terminal prints:
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Oct/2022 14:05:09] "GET /static/foo.html HTTP/1.1" 304 -
     -When the user accesses 127.0.0.1/static/foo.html through the web browser, a request is made to the web server for the /static/foo.html file
     which is then passed to the web browser to be rendered

-When the web browser receives a HTML file, the text in-between the tags '<html>' and '</html>' will be displayed/rendered.

-When you try to access any file in the static folder without static/ in the link, it displays a 404 error in the terminal.

-The numbers at the end of the lines in terminal like "200," "304" or "404" could represent types of requests of the web server, as in a download,
rendering, or error.
