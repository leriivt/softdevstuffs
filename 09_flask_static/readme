Prediction for foo.html:
Going to http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html would 
lead to a website displaying one line "Is this plaintext, though?"

Prediction was true

Q: What happens when you access this file
     via
      http://localhost:5000/static/foo 
     ?

Prediction for foo:
Either everything in foo is diplayed (on one line?) or
You get an error or
You get the same thing as http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html

Notes:
What ends up happening is the web browser downloads foo 
when http://localhost:5000/static/foo is accessed by user
and terminal prints 
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Oct/2022 13:49:15] "GET /static/foo HTTP/1.1" 200 -



127.0.0.1 - - [11/Oct/2022 14:05:09] "GET /static/foo.html HTTP/1.1" 304 -
