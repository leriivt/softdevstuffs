K10 -- templates in Flask

QCC:
What is the point of assigning coll to collection in render_template() argument? What if it is just left as coll?
You get the error SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument 

DISCO:
You can import multiple functions from the same module by separating them with commas.
@app.route() can be used multiple times with different routes to a site

#Q0: What will happen if you remove render_template from this line? (log your prediction before you pull the trigger...)
Prediction: You would get an error in the terminal because the function render_template wouldnt be defined
Actual result:
The terminal prints:
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Oct/2022 20:12:06] "GET /my_foist_template HTTP/1.1" 500 -  
NameError: name 'render_template' is not defined   
and the web browser gives the error:
NameError
NameError: name 'render_template' is not defined
and that "The debugger caught an exception in your WSGI application."


#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
Prediction: http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template
(true)

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument? Simplest, most concise answer best.
'model_tmplt.html'refers to the file name of the template flask will use.
foo="fooooo" tells flask to replace each instance of foo in the template with "fooooo"
collection=coll tells flask to replace each instance of collection in the template with coll (a list of [0,1,1,2,3,5,8])

predicted website display:
fooooo 
0
1
1
2
3
5
8

Actual result: fooooo turned out to be the name of the tab and the list of numbers was just displayed by itself
